* Yapfify 
Yapfify uses yapf to format a Python buffer. It can be called explicitly on a
certain buffer, but more conveniently, a minor-mode 'yapf-mode' is provided
that turns on automatically running YAPF on a buffer before saving.

* Installation:

Add yapfify.el to your load-path.

To automatically format all Python buffers before saving, add the function
yapf-mode to python-mode-hook:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'yapf-mode)
#+END_SRC

* Why not py-yapf?

Py-yapf works on a temporary file (placed in /tmp). Therefore it does not pick
up on any project specific YAPF styles. Yapfify works on the original file, so
that any project settings supported by YAPF itself are used.
